# VERSO – Liaisons Auditing Profiles – Documentation  

**Contacts**: Jeremy, Devin, Norm

## 1 - Task  

The Research Impact Team would like liaisons to review VERSO profiles in their liaison areas to ensure the following:  

1. All faculty are included (post-docs and other researchers will be addressed later).  
2. Information in profiles is of good quality.

## 3 - Workflow  

### 3.1 - Research Unit Pages  
**Video Timestamp: 1:00 – 2:30**  
1. Navigate to the **“researchers”** tab of your liaison area’s page. ([VERSO link to liaison areas](https://verso.uidaho.edu/esploro/research-units?institution=01ALLIANCE_UID))  
2. Compare the collection of researchers on that page with the directory or the [Shared Spreadsheet](https://vandalsuidaho.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/Storage-Library/Documents/shared/Teams/Research%20Impact%20Team/Liaisons%20-%20VERSO%20Auditing/Shared%20spreadsheet%20-%20university-faculty-list-ay-22-23.xlsx?d=w18d2daf17ae34a17ab2677be52fde94e&csf=1&web=1&e=8cnlIL).  
3. Make note of any missing faculty.

### 3.2 - Individual Researcher Pages  

#### 3.2.1 - Overview Tab  
**Video Timestamp: 2:30 – 4:50**  
Double-check the following fields:  
- **Name**  
- **Organizational affiliations**:  
  - Ensure all affiliations are listed.  
  - Academic rank should be on top.  
- **Bolded text** underneath the profile picture should display academic rank.  
- **Education section**:  
  - Does it exist?  
  - Does it contain relevant information?  
- (If applicable) **Research topics and keywords**  

Note any corrections in the [Shared Spreadsheet](https://vandalsuidaho.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/Storage-Library/Documents/shared/Teams/Research%20Impact%20Team/Liaisons%20-%20VERSO%20Auditing/Shared%20spreadsheet%20-%20university-faculty-list-ay-22-23.xlsx?d=w18d2daf17ae34a17ab2677be52fde94e&csf=1&web=1&e=8cnlIL).  

---

#### 3.2.2 - Output Tab  
**Video Timestamp: 4:50 – 8:30**  
Using researcher web profiles or Google Scholar profiles, check for errors in research output metadata, such as:  
- Publications that don’t belong to the researcher.  
- Typos in the title field.  
- Incorrect categorization (e.g., journal article marked as book chapter, etc.).  
- Duplicate/redundant entries.  
- Missing significant outputs.  

Do **not** record these issues in the shared spreadsheet. Note them elsewhere and send them to Jeremy, Devin, or Norm.  

---

#### 3.2.3 - Projects/Awards/Activities Tab  
**Video Timestamp: 8:30 – 9:30**  
If you think this section should be prioritized over others (e.g., improving the education field, adding researchers, or refining the research outputs tab), contact Jeremy, Norm, or Devin.
