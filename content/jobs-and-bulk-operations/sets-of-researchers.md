## Creating a set of researchers 

Last Updated: 2/20/2024, Devin Becker

* Go to Admin \> Manage Sets  
* Click on the "Create Itemized Set" button at the top (Logical sets will not work with this\!\!)  
* Name your set something like "CLASS\_jamm" that indicates which department/org is being grouped  
* Change the content type to "Researchers"   
* Make the Set "public" by unclicking the "private" option  
* Then click Create

* On the next screen, enter the affiliation you're looking for in the Affiliation box above the table.   
  * This is an auto-complete box, so once you see the department you're looking for, select it.   
  * The list below will limit down to those members associated with the department.    
* Double check that everyone who is there should be there.   
  * If a department is missing someone, email Norm and ask him to add them.   
  * If someone shouldn't be in the department, also email Norm and ask him to remove them.  
* Select all members that are correctly associated (hopefully this is everyone\!).   
* Click the Add Selected button at the top, and then click Save.
